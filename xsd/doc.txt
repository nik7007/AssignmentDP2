This XML schema allows to have an XML without any information, but also an undefined number of workflow and process.
Each element has its own complex type, so the entire schema can be easily expended and used for other purposes.

The characteristics of each element are store as attribute, it can have, at most some elements can have a
sub-element also described by its attributes.

Because the workflow's name identify the element, and each workflow are unique int the entire, the name attribute
is the only ID in the entire file.
This ID is referenced by the process action and by the process.

The name of any action is unique but only inside the same workflow.
Two different workflow can have an action with the same name, but inside the same workflow is not possible.
So inside the workflow element the name of any action is defined as a key (using a special element).
The nex possible action (sub_action element) references it.
